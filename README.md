# Folding@Home Container

Folding@home is a distributed computing project aimed to help scientists develop new therapeutics to a variety of diseases by the means of simulating protein dynamics.  
This includes the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins, and is reliant on the simulations run on the volunteers' personal computers.  
Folding@home is currently based at Washington University in St. Louis and led by Greg Bowman, a former student of Vijay Pande.

The Folding@Home software runs while you do other things.

While you keep going with your everyday activities, your computer will be working to help find cures for diseases like cancer, ALS, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, Influenza and many others.  
Today, Folding@Home project is focusing the compute power on SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and the human proteins the virus interacts with.

This container image allows you to quickly run and participate to the Folding@Home project.

A YAML file is also present to help you run Folding@Home in an [Azure Container Instance (ACI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-gpu), GPU-backed.
