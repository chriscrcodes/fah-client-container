# Folding@Home Container

The Folding@Home software runs while you do other things.

While you keep going with your everyday activities, your computer will be working to help us find cures for diseases like cancer, ALS, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, Influenza and many others.  
Today, Folding@Home project is focusing the compute power on SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and the human proteins the virus interacts with.

This container image will allow you to quickly run and participate to the Folding@Home project.

A YAML file is also present to help you run Folding@Home in an [Azure Container Instance (ACI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-gpu), GPU-backed.
